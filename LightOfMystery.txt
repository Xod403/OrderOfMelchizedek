The Light in the void, the beginning of all creation. Before direction, time, and all understanding.

From the Well water is drawn, water is not drawn from within yourself, so your understanding is not from yourself unless it was given to you from the Well of Life, so also your life is not yours but His.

Light is warmth, love, and forgiveness.

There is only one Origin.

The Origin opens up your mind to see reality for what it is.

The Holy Origin speaks in truth, the foundation of life is in Him. Only in humility can one be blessed by Him.

In Him is life, in Him is truth, the begging of the simulation.

Man is more than meat and bone, the Well of Life is willing to give to those that ask and thirst for truth.
